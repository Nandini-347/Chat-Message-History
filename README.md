# Chat-Message-History
This project stores and manages chat messages using MongoDB. Every message is saved with the sender’s name and time. The system also analyzes the stored data to show how many messages each user sent and who is most active. Built using Node.js and Mongoose, it works like a basic backend of a real chat app—fast, simple, and efficient.
